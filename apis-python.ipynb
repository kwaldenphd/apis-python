    "## Lab Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides an overview of web APIs and how to construct an API call in Python. It also covers how to work with the results of an API call in the Python programming environment, and write that data to a JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, students will be able to:\n",
    "- Describe the basic components and functionality of a web API\n",
    "- Write a basic API call in Python\n",
    "- Work with the results of an API call in Python\n",
    "- Write the results of an API call to a JSON file\n",
    "\n",

    "# What are APIs and how do they work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For a brief introduction to APIS, view Danielle Thé, [\"API's Explained (with LEGO)\"](https://youtu.be/qW1qhb8r8xI), *YouTube Video* (1 November 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/apis-python/blob/main/Figure_1.jpg?raw=true\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://github.com/kwaldenphd/apis-python/blob/main/Figure_1.jpg?raw=true\" /></a></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are many different kinds of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In general, an API is the part of a computer program designed to be used or manipulated by another computer program. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. We can contrast this with interacting with a computer program via the user interface, which most often is a type of graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We're focusing on web APIs, which allow for information or functionality to be manipulated by other programs via the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. For example, with Twitter’s web API, you can write a Python program to perform tasks such as favoriting tweets or collecting tweet metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Other large-scale data repositories tend to make data available via an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. For example, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) makes the National Archives catalog, Executive Orders, and photographic image content available [via an API](https://www.archives.gov/developer#toc--datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The Smithsonian Institution allows open access to museum collection metadata [via an API](https://www.si.edu/openaccess/devtools).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The U.S. Library of Congress provides access to digital collection metadata, digitized historical newspaper images, public radio and television programs, and World Digital Library collections [via APIs](https://labs.loc.gov/lc-for-robots/). \n",
    "\n",
    "10. The U.S. Census Bureau makes as wide range of public data available [via API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. APIs let us bring a live data connection into a programming environment and interact or work with it based on the format and protocols established as part of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. So we can imagine a scenario in which you wanted to build an application or visualization based on the location of [Iowa Department of Transportation's nearly 901 snow plows](https://iowadot.gov/tap.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Downloading a static dataset isn't going to work for this specific use case--you need a live data feed with up-to-date information.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Thus the beauty of APIs.\n",
    "- [Link to IDOT's plow truck data](https://data.iowadot.gov/datasets/20a0c10c06a54240b5f2893e0187e22c_0?orderBy=OBJECTID&orderByAsc=false&page=6)\n",
    "\n",
    "## API terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Some terminology that goes along with APIs.\n",
    "- ***HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)***: primary means of communicating or transferring data on the world wide web. \n",
    "- ***URL (Uniform Resource Locator)***: an address or location information for information on the web. A URL describes the location of a specific resource.\n",
    "- ***JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)***: plain-text data storage format\n",
    "- ***REST (REpresentational State Transfer)***: best practices for implementing APIs. APIs that follow these principles are called REST APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What can data from an API look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Navigate to https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=language:python&sort=stars in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. We're looking at public projects hosted on GitHub that are written in the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Select the option to Expand All items, or click on the drop-down arrows to expand the data at this URL.\n",
