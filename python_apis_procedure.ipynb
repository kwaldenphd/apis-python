        "There are many different kinds of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In general, an API is the part of a computer program designed to be used or manipulated by another computer program. We can contrast this with interacting with a computer program via the user interface, which most often is a type of graphical user interface (GUI).\n",

        "We're focusing on web APIs, which allow for information or functionality to be manipulated by other programs via the internet. For example, with [Twitter’s web API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api), you can write a Python program to perform tasks such as favoriting tweets or collecting tweet metadata.\n",
