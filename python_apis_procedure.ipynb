        "\n",
        "1. For a brief introduction to APIs, view Danielle Thé, [\"API's Explained (with LEGO)\"](https://youtu.be/qW1qhb8r8xI), *YouTube Video* (1 November 2016).\n",

        "\n",
        "2. There are many different kinds of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In general, an API is the part of a computer program designed to be used or manipulated by another computer program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. We can contrast this with interacting with a computer program via the user interface, which most often is a type of graphical user interface (GUI).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. We're focusing on web APIs, which allow for information or functionality to be manipulated by other programs via the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. For example, with [Twitter’s web API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api), you can write a Python program to perform tasks such as favoriting tweets or collecting tweet metadata.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Other large-scale data repositories tend to make data available via an API.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. For example, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) makes the National Archives catalog, Executive Orders, and photographic image content available [via an API](https://www.archives.gov/developer#toc--datasets).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The Smithsonian Institution allows open access to museum collection metadata [via an API](https://www.si.edu/openaccess/devtools).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. The U.S. Library of Congress provides access to digital collection metadata, digitized historical newspaper images, public radio and television programs, and World Digital Library collections [via APIs](https://labs.loc.gov/lc-for-robots/). \n",
        "\n",
        "10. The U.S. Census Bureau makes a wide range of public data available [via API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. APIs let us bring a live data connection into a programming environment and interact or work with it based on the format and protocols established as part of the API.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. So we can imagine a scenario in which you wanted to build an application or visualization based on the location of [Iowa Department of Transportation's nearly 901 snow plows](https://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/pages/winter).\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Downloading a static dataset isn't going to work for this specific use case--you need a live data feed with up-to-date information.\n",
